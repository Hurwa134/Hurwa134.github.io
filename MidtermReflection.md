# Midterm Reflection

## Thoughts on Research Question & Further Exploration


The feedback I received regarding my research question and Midterm presentation is extremely helpful. It is giving me excellent pointers and jumping off points for deeper exploration and research. I think it is especially interesting that I was directed towards the Fluxus art movement of the 1960’s, which I had actually never heard of, despite my familiarity with Yoko Ono. 

Going back to my research questions, they are: 

Broad Question: How do music and color affect emotion? 

Specific Question: How can I express the ethereal/spiritual nature of music?

Looking into the Fluxus movement and its artists, I immediately felt like it resonated closely with me. For example, reading about the history of Fluxus, I came across this explanation:

“Fluxus’s spirit of rebellion against the commercial art market, elitism, and the conventions of both art and society had its roots in Dada, Futurism, and Surrealism, while its irreverence and youthful energy were in tune with the burgeoning counterculture of the 1960s.” – “What is Fluxus?” (https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-fluxus-movement-art-museums-galleries)

I especially love that artists, poets, and musicians were all a part of this movement and that it was truly international (though based/originated in NYC.) I fully relate to the “spirit of rebellion” that Fluxus is said to have had, as well as the 1960’s counterculture energy. My parents were part of that movement (1960s hippie counterculture) and I am heavily influenced by that world as a person, so definitely as an artist. I agree with the Fluxus message of dismantling establishment/corporate/classist classifications of art, and absolutely agree with the idea that art and life are interconnected to the point that they can be considered inextricable. In fact, I think that’s very similar to what I’m trying to point out regarding the “spiritual” nature of the music experience. The exultant, ephemeral nature of music whether experienced as a listener or a creator, is something primal and essential to human experience, in my opinion. 

“The movement attracted a loosely affiliated, international group of artists, designers, poets, and musicians who readily embraced one of its central tenets: the total integration of art and life.” -from “What is Fluxus?” (https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-fluxus-movement-art-museums-galleries)

I will admit, I don’t yet totally understand what they meant when they referenced a total integration of art and life. I also want to better understand the philosophy of the Dada movement – I don’t completely understand the “anti-art art” sentiment, which the Dada movement also claimed as a core attribute. I have actually applied this phrase to fashion, “anti-fashion” in terms of rejecting trends and the fashion industry. I understand anti-art art in the same way, it should be fully accessible and not dictated by an ‘authority.’ I’m also very intrigued by the “absurdist” philosophy in the Dada art movement and am not sure I understand it. 

I also love that the Fluxus movement was “intentionally uncategorizable.” 

“Intentionally uncategorizable, Fluxus projects were wide-ranging and often multidisciplinary, humorous, and based in everyday, inexpensive materials and experiences…” - “What is Fluxus?” (https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-fluxus-movement-art-museums-galleries)

I absolutely want to follow/continue to follow the thread of surrealism which I feel connects my work. I was excited to see that the Fluxus movement is compared to the surrealists. 

Definition of Surrealism: 

“A movement embracing the irrational as a means of creating art and experiencing life, whose founding document is the Surrealist Manifesto composed by André Breton in 1924. Taking pure psychic automatism as the ideal state of man, Surrealists believed that one could express the true functioning of thought in the unconscious. Initially, the most important aspect of the unconscious was desire, which they felt was central to humanity—the authentic voice of the inner self and the key to understanding human beings. Dreams, childhood, madness, non-Western art, and chance situations became central to discovering the irrational in Surrealist art.” – Artsy.net, Surrealism (https://www.artsy.net/gene/surrealism)

I was also happy to see that Fluxus was also compared to the Futurists (first movement) – specifically in the Futurists creation of “total works of art.” Gesamtkunstwerk or “total artwork”, is a term that continuously came up for me leading up to my midterm presentation. I am particularly interested in a “total artwork.” 

“While best known for a dynamic style in painting and sculpture that captured speed and movement as if in time-lapse, Futurist artists created “total works of art” (performance, installation, fashion, and more).” – Artsy.net, Futurism
(https://www.artsy.net/gene/futurism)

I also loved that the Fluxus movement’s output is described as “informal, spontaneous, and often ephemeral pieces…” as one of the aspects of music I want to try to express is its ephemeral nature, just as much as it is “spiritual” or otherworldly. I think that this ties into surrealism well, and I’m excited to delve into it further. I think that I have an interesting research question, and I think it could go in many different directions. I do want to keep it closely related to the concepts of color, emotion, and memories as those are themes/aspects that I think are important to this exploration. I’ve definitely concluded that my project should be subjective to my own experience/expression, and I loved the feedback about receiving something specific from the audience in return. I have never considered that, and it certainly gives me something to think about. Off the top of my head, I would say that what I would hope to receive from the audience in return would be a genuine, emotional experience, and maybe some kind of similarly genuine, emotional response. 

Other aspects I want to touch on in my project include: 

Romanticism (emphasis on the senses, emotions) via a multi-modal work (Audio/visual/other) and uniting the senses. 

I want to consider the question of - how can a composition of frequencies, audio/visual effect how I feel?

I think looking at the surrealists, the futurists, and Dada, as well as the Fluxus movement gives me a really good foundation for further exploring my research question and these ideas.
