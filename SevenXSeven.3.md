# Seven In Seven 

## Day 3. Protype 3

Testing the function,look, and feel of visuals illustrating Day 3 guitar meditation/prayer. 
Again trying to create "visual music", I used the theme that came to me during the meditation of "home." I was trying to express prayer/meditation as a way to access the feeling of being home, or the feeling of being at home in yourself.

### How I Approached my Second Prototype

I did another guitar playing session as a prayer/meditation in a garden. I was feeling better and wanted to see how playing outside would effect the mood of the music. It was actually quite cold out, and my fingers got cold, and my guitar string broke - but I continued on and played anyway. I was thinking about the theme of "home."

### Accompanying visuals, Day #3:

Again trying to create "visual music", I used the theme that came to me during the meditation of "home" or "home is where the heart is" to create a video of imagery to accompany the music. I realized that there was a house in the garden, it looked like a dollhouse.

I found that there were little houses made of wood, in the garden I was playing in. When I looked around me more closely, I realized that the garden was decorated with probably close to 100 small, decorative wooden birdhouses of different shapes, colors and sizes. I went around the garden with my camera filming them, and noticing other creative decor details like an old fashioned clock and sculptures. 

 I also found a memorial to an theater artist/poet/sculptress in the garden and included that as well.  One of my guiding principles was that I wanted the project to be elegaic and focus on the ephemeral/transient quality of music. The memorial to the artist captured this emotion well. The garden that I was in was called "The Creative Little Garden." It felt like synchronicity to be meditating on the theme of "home" and praying to feel like I found it within myself, and to look closely to find so many tiny little hoouses in the garden. It couldn't have been more symbolic of what I was thinking about.

When I edited the video of the guitar prayer session, I realized there was a clip where some people had come up to me and asked if they could listen to the music. I said sure, and somehow it came up that they were talking about the Catskills and Upstate NY. I let them know I am from Ithaca, NY and then said "home." The woman asked, "how far away is Ithaca?" I edited the video so that the question lingers unanswered, and then cuts to my playing guitar. When I play guitar, I feel at home. So, through the video editing I am trying to express that Ithaca (home) is only as far away as my guitar.
