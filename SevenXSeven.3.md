# Seven In Seven 

## Day 3. Protype 3

Testing the function,look, and feel of visuals illustrating Day 3 guitar meditation/prayer. 
Again trying to create "visual music", I used the theme that came to me during the meditation of "home." I was trying to express prayer/meditation as a way to access the feeling of being home, or the feeling of being at home in yourself.

### How I Approached my Third Prototype

I did another guitar playing session as a prayer/meditation in a garden. I was feeling better and wanted to see how playing outside would effect the mood of the music. It was actually quite cold out, and my fingers got cold, and my guitar string broke - but I continued playing.

I edited all of the footage from the Garden to accompany the soundtrack I created there. I also added footage of myself putting on lipstick, to symbolize the personal aspect of action (playing guitar, making music) with the way that it makes me feel at home. In this way I was trying to create something of a self portrait. I used video effects to make it seem dreamy and surreal, and to give it a more psychedellic feel.

When I was playing my mediation/prayer, I realized that I feel at home when I play guitar. My prayer was to feel at home, or the idea of being at home in myself. The idea for the visuals is to express that "home is where the heart is", and the sentiment of praying to feel at home in yourself and realizing you feel at home when you play music. To create a video of imagery to accompany the music, I shot footage of items in the garden and the scenery. 

I realized to my surprise that there was a wooden house in the garden, it looked like a dollhouse.

I found that there were little houses made of wood, in the garden I was playing in. When I looked around me more closely, I realized that the garden was decorated with probably close to 100 small, decorative wooden birdhouses of different shapes, colors and sizes. I went around the garden with my camera filming them, and noticing other creative decor details like an old fashioned clock and sculptures. 

I also found a memorial to an theater artist/poet/sculptress in the garden and included that as well.  One of my guiding principles was that I wanted the project to be elegaic and focus on the ephemeral/transient quality of music. The memorial to the artist captured this emotion well. The garden that I was in was called "The Creative Little Garden." It felt like synchronicity to be meditating on the theme of "home" and praying to feel like I found it within myself, and to look closely to find so many tiny little hoouses in the garden. It couldn't have been more symbolic of what I was thinking about.

When I edited the video of the guitar prayer session, I realized there was a clip where some people had come up to me and asked if they could listen to the music. I said sure, and somehow it came up that they were talking about the Catskills and Upstate NY. I let them know I am from Ithaca, NY and then said "home." The woman asked, "how far away is Ithaca?" I edited the video so that the question lingers unanswered, and then cuts to my playing guitar. When I play guitar, I feel at home. So, through the video editing I am trying to express that Ithaca (home) is only as far away as my guitar.
