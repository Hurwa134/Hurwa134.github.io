# Seven In Seven 

## Day 3. Protype 3

Testing the function,look, and feel of visuals illustrating Day 3 guitar meditation/prayer. 
Again trying to create "visual music", I used the theme that came to me during the meditation of "home" or "home is where the heart is" to create a video of imagery to accompany the music. I found that there were little houses made of wood, and specifically a lot of bird housese, in the garden I was playing in. I also found artwork and a memorial to an artist/poet/sculptress in the garden and included that as one of my guiding principles was that I wanted the project to be "elegaic" and focus on the ephemeral/transient quality of music.

### How I Approached my Second Prototype

I did another guitar playing session as a prayer/meditation in a garden. I was feeling better and wanted to see how playing outside would effect the mood of the music. It was actually quite cold out, and my fingers got cold, and my guitar string broke - but I continued on and played anyway. I was thinking about the theme of "home."
