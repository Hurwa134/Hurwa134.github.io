# Seven In Seven 

## Day 1. Protype 1

### My research questions are: 

What if music was a religion to me? & How can I express the ethereal/spiritual nature of music? 


For the Seven in Seven project, I intend to do a guitar meditation each day, and create some kind of visual experience to accompany each guitar session. Playing guitar as a meditation every day for seven days is my way of answering the question "What if Music was a Religion (to me)?" In this way, my meditation guitar sessions are my prayers.

Each guitar session as my prayer through music. 

I read something that Yoko Ono said about her work, saying "everything I make is a wish" , so I am trying to apply that to my Seven in Seven pieces in a sense. In this case, every piece is a prayer.

There are hand positions in yoga called mudras, which have different meanings. Source: [The Power of Hand Mudras and Their Meanings.](https://www.azulfit.com/hand-mudras-power-and-meaning/)

I listened again to the guitar meditation that I created and then I tried to express the music through hand mudras. To give the mudras a more ethereal/temporary aesthetic, I tried to make shadows of them with my hands. I was testing the look and feel of this approach, as well as the function (was it an effective way to express the music/prayer visually?)

I like the idea of a choreographed "dance" made of hand mudras, to express the music through a hand-mudra-dance that is a prayer that also has meaning behind the different hand gestures.
