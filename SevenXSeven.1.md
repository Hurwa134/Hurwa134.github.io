# Seven In Seven 

## Day 1. Protype 1

### My research questions are: 

What if music was a religion to me? & How can I express the ethereal/spiritual nature of music? 

For the Seven in Seven project, I intend to do a guitar meditation each day, and create some kind of visual experience to accompany each guitar session. Playing guitar as a meditation every day, for seven days in a row, is my way of showing what it would be like if music were a religion to me.  In this way, I am considering my meditation/guitar sessions to be my prayers.

I am inspired by the concept of Wabi-Sabi, or imperfect beauty. Something that holds me back from practicing guitar (something I love) has been my perfectionism. If I make mistakes during my meditation music it's imperfect beauty, and I won't judge it.

Each guitar session as prayer through music could inspire different visual art or an accompanying experience or interaction. 

I read something that Yoko Ono said about her work, saying "everything I make is a wish" , so I am trying to apply that to my Seven in Seven pieces in a sense. In this case, every piece I want to make is a prayer.

There are hand positions in yoga called mudras, which have different spiritual meanings.

I listened again to the guitar meditation that I created and then I tried to express the music through hand mudra shapes. To give the mudras a more ethereal/temporary aesthetic, I tried to make shadows of the mudras on the wall with a flashlight. I was testing the look and feel of this approach, in this prototype as well as the function. I wondered if this idea would be an effective way to express the music/prayer visually?

I like the idea of a choreographed "dance" made by the hand mudra shadows to the music, especially as both are improvised (the music) and then the choreography of the improvised mudra movements as in a dance, to the music. I tried to express the music through a hand mudra dance through shadows,which is also like a prayer. There are symbolic and yogic meanings and intentions behind the different hand gestures.

If I try this approach again I would definitely like to rent a tripod, because I was having trouble getting the phone/camera balanced in addition to the flash light to free up both of my hands to do the choreography. I also realized that hand mudras are not easy, and I would like to memorize the meanings behind them so that I can more easily free-style a more meaningful choreographed, improvised dance with my hands. It was difficult because I didn't know what they meant or what the correct shapes were so I had to scroll through them on my computer while I recorded, which made it a little less graceful. If I can memorize the hand movements and their meanings and have my hands totally free, I think it could be very graceful and express the ethereal/spiritual nature of the music really well. I like this idea.

The first time I thought of the idea of the spiritual aspect of music that I want to express, during a meditation to music for the observational phase I envisioned "hand movements." I had also envisioned something similar to finger-painting, so if there is a way I can include color in this prototype, like adding a light show/colored projection element, I think that might be really beautiful and expressive.
