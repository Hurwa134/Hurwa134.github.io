# Me, My Data

## My Data Visualizations


*Postcard* 

I mapped the times that I wanted to listen to music throughout a day. I found that I wanted to all the time, or at least, whenever I thought of it so I made notes when listening to music came to mind. I also used my Spotify user data, which shows my listening habits over a typical 24 hour period, based on my aggregate music-streaming data over the past year. I drew a line graph on posterboard the size of a postcard which I covered in black fabric. I drew on the fabric with glitter glue and fabric paint and indicated time of day with Roman numerals. 

I also tried to map out when I was inspired by color/visuals during the day, in a musical sense. For example, when I saw a bright bouquet of flowers at the farmers market, I noticed I felt musically inspired. I came to the conclusion that it would make sense for me to document these moments of color-induced-musical-inspiration at an art gallery or museum.

_Visual Interpretation: [Bill Evans, "Like Someone in Love"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFoapxPvZy4&list=RDQFoapxPvZy4&start_radio=1)_

I listened to the song (four or five times) and interpreted the cadences of the melody, and how the song made me feel on an emotional level with an abstracted line graph over the course of the length of the song. I expressed the melody and how it made me feel; how I interpret the melody in terms of movement and rhythm. I also incorporated rhythm by illustrating the song not only with the line drawings but also with the texture of the line. Looking closely you can see some of the silver glitter paint is actually drawn with dots to emphasize and accent the rhythm. I wanted to illustrate the song through a fashion-like aesthetic, to express the melody as a pattern that you might find on a textile or a textile art, which is why I covered the posterboard in fabric and fabric paint. 

I enjoyed making it more abstract and trying to emphasize the rhythm and melody with multiple colors. I'd like to try it again with other songs, genre's of music, and/or songs with more instruments. I especially like the approach used by Stuart Davis in his jazz paintings of illustrating the rhythm and expression of different instruments in a song with different colors. I like the concept of a multicolored paintingwhich expresses a song's instruments as a visual collage. 

## Inspiration

### *Stuart Davis*

_Hot Still-Scape for Six Colors - 7th Avenue Style (1940)_

Stuart Davis was one of the first American artists to consider jazz and swing to as the musical counterpart to abstract art. Davis explained, "[It] is called Hot [a jazz term] because of its dynamic mood" akin to the energy and improvisation in jazz music. The six colors "are used as the instruments in a musical composition might be, where the tone-color variety results from the simultaneous juxtaposition of different instrument groups." He worked with the idea of combining the senses and incoprorating the movement and rhythm of jazz into his visual work. 

### *Susan Novak*

According to art historian Gregory Minissale in his article [_Topoligcal Diagrams_](http://drainmag.com/topological-diagrams/?fbclid=IwAR1Fv1jNcyFHHbj4PyOaplEag5D6UK8aYpgJntMUtHW0yjzZCUyVRXCU9jE) on Novak's installation _The Expanded Gallery, 2017_, "Accents create rhythmic pulse patterns in the kinaesthetics experienced by the viewer captured within the language of architecture. The diagram does not represent but helps to produce complex rhythms across brain, body and world."  

He describes a kind of "celestial physics" which has "come down to earth in the form of music" and which "continues to pattern the imagination and various artistic practices that snag its rhythms and proportions." He describes rhythm itself as more fundamental than music, saying that it travels and is translated by the senses into musicality.

I especially love the use of stained glass to create this work, as that touches on the aspect of spirituality or "altered consciousness", which I would love to incorporate into my project. Additionally, Novak references her work as a musician in addition to being a visual artist. She is a classically trained pianist and she discusses how synesthesia influences both her playing and her visual art. The angles and flashes of color in Novak's piece are described by Minissale as punctuated rhythm, or "accents", saying "Accents create rhythmic pulse patterns in the kinaesthetics experienced by the viewer...The diagram does not represent but helps to produce complex rhythms across brain, body and world."

Minissale also mentions mirror-neurons "...Novak’s geometric compositions also stimulate edge detection, mirror neurons, mental shape rotation, vertical and horizontal thrusts, chromatic salience and various tensions in figure-ground ambiguities – all of which do not simply function as tools for identifying an image _*...the complexity of audio-visual rhythm arises both as itself and abstract over and above any consideration of melody, motif or story."*_

I am very interested in this notion of rhythm, movement, and accents expressed visually. Novak has said of her work _"I aim to create worlds that bring the senses closer together."_ She not only designed the stain-glass architectural pieces but she did so in preparation for her upcoming piano performance in the location - creating a sort of "set design", or theater of visual art around her music performance which expresses her synesthesia.

I also learned about the concept of "Gesamtkunstwerk", in this article, relating to how Novak aims to express art which unifies the senses. Gesamtkunstwerk is a German word literally translated as "a total artwork"; it is a work of art that makes use of all or many art forms or strives to do so. Wagner, the 19th century German composer and opera creator coined the term in his description of opera as the ultimate artform because it allowed for a use of theater, literature, music, and set design, and he wanted a word to convey his thoughts on how important this was. (Source: https://www.sartle.com/blog/post/word-of-art-gesamtkunstwerk)
 
The concept of Gesamtkunstwerk aims to reconnect the senses and unify experience to arrive at some kind of "transcendence", explains Minissale. He also references a "well-known study of six jazz pianists by Limb and Braun" which discovered that "when musicians improvise and create spontaneous musical passages their brains’ highly conscious analytical and rational planning areas associated with the ‘executive’ system are deactivated. Limb and Braun suggest that this deactivation “may be associated with defocused, free-floating attention that permits spontaneous unplanned associations and sudden insights or realizations…to arrive at a solution without reasoning.” And this deactivation, they report, is also _*‘responsible for altered states of consciousness such as hypnosis, meditation or even daydreaming’.*_
