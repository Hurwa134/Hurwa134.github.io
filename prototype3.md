# Prototype Test III

## Public Date

The dining table set for two explores communication and the relationship between people at the table. The formal dining spread, like one would experience on a romantic date, is set in a dreamy, surreal, altered reality in an unexpected location. The larger-than-life objects and surrealist aesthetic invite the user into a dream-like situation. 

The reflective surfaces act as dividers in the center of the table, reflecting each individual’s side of the table and their own candle. This is a commentary on people’s preoccupation with playing with tech-devices and not being present in the company of others. Despite dining together at a table, each user is preoccupied with their remote control device and the isolation of their own reflection.

-Placemats with mirror surface in addition to the reflective slanted dividers.

-Plates (giant sized) which we place the remote control inside of.

-Lights shining on the remote controls placed inside of the giant plates.

-We set up a tripod with an iPhone video camera to capture interactions. 

-No convos at all between us and the strangers until after they had experienced the interaction.

## Style Feedback

EDM (Electronic Digital Music) festivals

The installation reminded someone of EDM (Electronic Digital Music) festivals where people incorporate glowing and light up fashion, jewelry, and accessories.

Seaglass Carousel at Battery Park

We were also told that the project reminded someone else of the Seaglass Carousel at Battery Park which incorporates ambient music and glowing underwater scenery.

## Meaningfulness

-Most people were unaware of the rich jazz history of the location and were excited to learn about the historical connection to the installation. 

-The original game play function of the ping-pong table maintains its influence and a layer of meaning: responsive, playful back-and-forth. 

-The theme of communication and connection is highlighted through the metaphor of lighting the other person’s candle. 

-The reflective mirrors mimic the experience of isolation resulting from people’s obsessions with their gadgets - interrupting what was once quality time during dinner. 

-We created the experience and influence for kids of art and music.

## Future Ideas

We would love to be able to program objects on one end of the table to light up or react when objects on the other side are moved or picked up. Ideally we would incorporate motion sensors.
Making more objects for the table is our ideal vision. We want to incorporate the remote control functionality into a giant spoon. The size of the remote needs to be increased to be more noticable. It would ideally light up and be very prominent. We would like the remote control to be hidden in a piece of silverware so that it is more meaningful to the expected dining experience.

Bigger, more easily recognizable remote control buttons on the spoon (big red and green buttons) would be ideal as some people didn’t notice the buttons on the existing remote control. 
The range of the sensor for the existing remote control is very limited. People had to point directly at the divider. Ideally a sensor with a wider range would be used.
