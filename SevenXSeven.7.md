# Seven In Seven 

## Day 7. Protype 7

Today I was having a rough day.  When I prayed I was asking for help. I was playing to escape how I feel a lot of the time, which isn't good. Music is an escape, but it's more than that - it's a relief, it's like a healing tonic that no matter how bad you feel or what the backdrop of your life is, it soothes you and let's you go into another world. Without music, I wouldn't be here. I played guitar even though I was feeling bad physically and emotionally, and it helped me a lot. It's definitely therapy. It brought back memories of people, and concerts I went to. 

For some reason when I was playing, I was thinking about a concert where I was so moved by a song that it brought me to tears. I was trying to connect to that feeling, and I was thinking about the musicians who inspire me. I tried to pay homage to two of my inspirations, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Nirvana, by trying to play a song that combined chords from two of their songs. I feel a really deep connection to the musicians who I have listened to since I was a teenager and who inspired me to become a musician.

I started using my looping pedal. It is really comforting to play meleodies over your own music, and when I can play music with myself either through a loop pedal, or recording, it's like I'm not alone anymore and it's like a mirror, but more interactive. When I play one track over another, I'm playing and collaborating with myself, and it's a kind of engagement and comfort that is really fulfilling.


### How I Approached my Third Prototype

The idea of a looping pedal, or playing tracks over eachother, and recording multiple tracks, makes me think of a mirror.
