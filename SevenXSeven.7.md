# Seven In Seven 

## Day 7. Protype 7

Today I was having a rough day.  When I prayed I was asking for help. I was playing to escape how I feel a lot of the time, which isn't good. Music is an escape, but it's more than that - it's a relief, it's like a healing tonic that no matter how bad you feel or what the backdrop of your life is, it soothes you and let's you go into another world. Without music, I wouldn't be here. I played guitar even though I was feeling bad physically and emotionally, and it helped me a lot. It's definitely therapy. It brought back memories of people, and concerts I went to. 

For some reason when I was playing, I was thinking about a concert where I was so moved by a song that it brought me to tears. I was trying to connect to that feeling, and I was thinking about the musicians who inspire me. I tried to pay homage to two of my inspirations, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Nirvana, by trying to improvise a song that combined chords from two of their songs. 

I feel a really deep connection to the musicians who I have listened to since I was a teenager and who inspired me to become a musician.

I started using my looping pedal. It is really comforting to play meleodies over your own music, and when I can play music with myself either through a loop pedal, or recording, it's like I'm not alone anymore and it's like a mirror, but more interactive. When I play one track over another, I'm playing and collaborating with myself, and it's a kind of engagement and comfort that is really fulfilling.

### How I Approached my Third Prototype

The idea of a looping pedal, or playing tracks over eachother, and recording multiple tracks, makes me think of a mirror. Playing music tracks over one another, in a sense "jamming" with yourself, is like having a mirror to reflect back to you and play with. I don't know how I could illustrate this visually, but I'm thinking about a mirror and this idea.

The idea of a looping pedal, or playing tracks over eachother, and recording multiple tracks, makes me think of a mirror.

I don't know how I could illustrate this visually, but I'm thinking about a mirror and this idea. 


Another idea using the lotus flower; a white sculpture of the lotus could have different colors projected onto it. The different lotus flower colors represent different things in Buddhism: gold (enlightenment), purple (mysticism & spirituality), pink (the highest of spirituality, the Buddha's symbol), blue (victory of the spirit over the senses/wisdom), red (heart, love, compassion), white (purity of the mind, heart of the Buddha, the White Tara and her perfect nature.) I made a lotus sculpture out of play-dough, I think it would be best if it were white, but the lightest color I have is yellow. I tried to use a colored transparent piece of cellophane like a colored lense over the flashlight to try to alter the color, but it still looked yellow. I also played with the strobe effect on the flashlight, so I think colors and strobe, using the light and colors to punctuate the music as in "visual music", like a choreographed expression of the music that I create would be really pretty and ethereal.

Since I was thinking so much about the artists who brought me so much comfort and meaning in my life, 
I thought it would be an interesting idea to take audio clips of those artists talking, or singing, and make an audio collage over my own song, to represent that I take my influences with me and also that they are like my angels, or guides, and that I think about them when I play.  

Some of my favorite artists are gone from this world, but they are immortal in a sense because they live on through their music. This is a spiritual idea but it's also something that I have read drives artists to create - humans, and artists through their art, strive to create something that outlives them. I think music does this in a profound way. I also feel such a close relationship with the artists I listen to, and I care about them in a sense, as if I know them. 

I also thought about the idea of the Mobius strip, which is another symbol of eternal life or immortality. I'm not sure how I could include the mobius strip or other symbols of immortality, but maybe it could be projected, or incorporated somehow. I made a paper mobius strip as a prototype. I envision it as a floating sculpture, so it could be hung with "invisible" thread so that it looks like it's floating in the air, and then something could be projected onto it. The lotus could also hang from "invisible" thread, I think the vision of sculptures looking like they are "floating" and then having light shine colors on them with a strobe effect programmed to sync with the music could be really beautiful. I think it is possible to do this, at least rhythm-wise, through Ableton Live. I don't know how else I could incorproate the music but I like the idea of the voices of musicians that inspire me being incorporated to show how they "live on" through their music.
