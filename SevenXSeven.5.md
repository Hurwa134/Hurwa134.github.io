# Seven In Seven 

## Day 5. Protype 5

I was feeling exhausted, and really unwell, and I didn't want to play guitar. I decided to take a bath first and then forced myself to play. I can tell that my playing and the music is much more "sleepy" which reflects how I felt. I remembered how playing makes me feel like I can escape reality and my worries, which was what motivated me to play. I just tried to express how I felt more and not try so hard. I reminded myself that it doesn't matter if I make a mistake, as long as I just play.

I wanted to create a prototype for how it would look/feel/function to paint what looks like stained glass and/or a mandala on a big sheet of ice. The ice will melt which represents impermanence and the ephemeral nature of music, and being in the moment.

I started by trying to paint on ice cubes with acrylic paint. It worked better than I thought it would. It also looked interesting as it started to melt.

I used the flashlight and strobe light to capture the visuals of actually painting the ice as well. I think using light on the painted ice makes an interesting effect.
