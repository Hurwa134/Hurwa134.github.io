I wanted to create a stained glass painting that looks like a stained glass mandala on a big sheet of ice. The ice will melt which represents impermanence and the ephemeral nature of music, and being in the moment.

I am not sure what the best way to make a big sheet of ice is so I started by trying to paint on ice cubes with acrylic paint.
