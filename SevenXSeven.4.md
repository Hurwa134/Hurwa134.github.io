# Seven In Seven 

## Day 4. Protype 4

Today I felt really tired and I didn't want to play guitar. This has been a really great practice for me to get back into playing. I tried to focus on it being a prayer/meditation and tried to communicate my feelings to a higher power. 

Something that came up for me was that it was fun, and that even though I was tired today and didn't feel well, once I started to play it was like all my anxiety and worries were far away. I was lost in the world of playing, and that feeling is very meditative. It's like an escape from reality. I also was able to have fun while playing and even felt connected to my sensuality. All of these things are very spiritual to me.

I had a lot of anxiety and frustrated energy, and I accessed a lot of anger. I prayed for my anger to leave me and to release it, and I was actuallly able to get some of my aggression and anxiety/anger out through playing. This is a huge gift. 

The hardest thing for me is to break through my perfectionism and my "I suck, I should just give up" when I haven't practiced much in years, and when I start to play and it feels like I'm not able to make my hands do what I want. I remembered that I want this expressive art work to reflect the philosophy of Wabi-Sabi and Kintsuki, and that it's okay that it's not "perfect" or when I mess up. Like in yoga when you fall, it's about getting back up. I tried to really embrace that and embrace my mistakes and sloppy playing, and it gave me a feeling of freedom and liberation. 

I also once read a book called "The Zen of Guitar" that said that every time you play a note, you should play it with all your heart, like you are crying out to the ocean. I tried to remember that. It would be interested to try to visualize that idea. 

I've been angry and frustrated at my body for being sick, and I felt like I was actually able to connect to a higher power, or unlock something in myself. I prayed to take my frustration and anger away, and it felt like the energy moved through me by playing - and I felt uplifted and energized, like it had come unblocked in me. 

I would love to relate this to the idea of Gestalt, aesthetically - and in terms of psychology. I felt like it was a music therapy session for me.
