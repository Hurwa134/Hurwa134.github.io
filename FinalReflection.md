# Final Reflection

## Thoughts on Final Project 


The feedback I received regarding my research question and final presentation were very helpful. Throughout the design process feedback and responses to ideas from classmates were also illuminating for deeper exploration and research. I really enjoyed the research process and delving into topics of interest to me in new ways. The iteration process and deep critical thinking that I undertook to create both the technical design and conceptual basis for this project were highly valuable learning experiences. 

### What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?

My prototypes attempted first to answer the question "what if music were my religion?" They also tried to answer questions related to: "how can I create a multi-modal audiovisual artistic expression?" and "how can I translate the ephemeral/less tangible aspect of music through audio and visual music?" I also asked "how can I create a multi-modal artistic output which unites the senses?"


### What are the three strengths of your project?

I think my project was successful in that it had a strong concept: expressing the spiritual/intangible aspect of music via a multi-modal, audiovisual artistic expression. I also managed to incorporate the idea of music being ephemeral and tied that theme to the concept of divination and spirituality through the form of tarot cards. The animation effect worked successfully through my production of illustrations which reflected the RGB pure colors coded with Processing to turn the laptop screen into a light source. I also thought that the idea of creating "album art" in the form of a divination card set which accompanies a music single was successfully imaginative. 


### What are the three most critical issues for your project?

The effect of the RGB animation is in itself an imperfect one - there is no way to prevent "some" light from either color from making the other colored illustration somewhat visible. I think there may be other animation and light effect techniques which I could explore in the future. Critically, I think I was held back by my lack of experience/skills in both design and coding/technology. I think I will be able to create more engaging visuals when I gain some technical skills. The song choice could have tied in with the symbolism/theme of "tarot" more directly - I think it would have been interesting to write a song with lyrics that incorporate the symbolism and imagery used in the tarot designs and card meanings more. This is something I am definitely interest in exploring in the future. 


### What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?

I think making strong connections between different conceptual themes and elements of the project is just as important as the foundational research question and underpinning concept. This is something I will continue to think about in creative work going forward. I will also take courses in coding and creative design so that I have some digital art skills. Continuing to explore my passions for visual art and music, and their connections are a true motivation for me creatively. 

### What new questions do you have?

Now my questions are more related to audiovisual productions and works of art which relate to both music and visual art. I'm interested in what skills I can gain to be able to create more visual music - whether it is animation, video, coding, or graphic design. I want to learn more about work in this area and what tools would be most helpful to do create work in theses areas. 


### How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a possible future direction?

This prototype provided me with the opportunity to make artistic connections between two fields of art which I am active and interested in: visual art and music/music production. This definitely feels like a rich and exciting future direction for me to continue to explore! I am very inspired to continue to work in this area and explore the ways that I can unite my creative skills in music, writing, and visual art.
