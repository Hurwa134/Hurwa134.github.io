# Seven In Seven 

## Day 2. Protype 2

Testing the function and look and feel of day two guitar meditation/prayer. I created spiritual symbols cut out of paper and filmed them in front of a mirror with colored light to illustrate "visual music.

### My research questions are: 

**What if music was a religion to me?**

 & 

 **How can I express the ethereal/spiritual nature of music?** 

### How I approached my Second Prototype

I did another guitar playing session as a prayer/meditation. However, I was feeling very sick and like I had a fever, and I was frustrated with my playing. I could tell that my state of mind was reflected in my playing, it had a more agitated, less calm quality. I focused on praying and what I thought about was that it is Halloween, or Samhein. This is the night that the "veil" is supposed to be lifted between the waking life and what we can't see, according to the lore. It also made me think about the idea of the Day of the Dead, and the idea of being able to communicate with your ancestors spiritually. I thought of my grandmother's who I never got to meet, who I believe watch over me. I wondered if in my prayer through music on Halloween I could connect with them better. 

I didn't feel well and was exasperated with my playing (it feels like I've forgotten how to play, I used to be so much better). What I rememered is that this exercise is like yoga, or a practice in the Wabi-Sabi philosphy - that there is beauty in imperfection. 

When I played I tried to think about what imagery would accompany this meditation/prayer playing session. I wanted to incorporate Halloween or Samhein because I was thinking about that and the idea of spirits and ancestors.

[Day Two Visuals - Spiritual Symbols on Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ63vhV7CMo)

Continuing with the idea of each guitar session as prayer through music inspiring a different visual art or an accompanying experience or interaction, I tried to think of spiritual symbols. I wanted first to include ghosts or spirits. I also wanted to include some kind of veil that could be lifted, like lifting a bridal veil on film, or lifting fabric to symbolize the "lifting of the veil" that seperates the "spiritual" world on Halloween according to legend. I wasn't sure how to illustrate that.

I looked up celtic symbols related to Samhein, and symbols related to Halloween but I wanted to stay closer to symbols that are meaningful to me personally and which remind me of my prayer or meditation. I think the symbolism in paganism and celtic lore, and the metaphor of the veil could be really interesting to incorporate visually however. 

I found the symbol of the lotus flower, which represents purity, and spirituality in Buddhism, as well as re-birth. It grows in the deepest muddiest places and is also a symbol of perserverence, like the pheonix. I also learned that different colored lotus flowers have different meanings in Buddhism and Eastern philosophies. The lotus is personally important to me as a symbol of spirituality relating to my yoga practice, so I drew two lotus flowers on white paper and cut them out.

Since I was thinking about my ancestors and relatives who I feel spiritually connected to during my meditation, I drew angel wings to represent them and cut them out of paper as well. 

I think there are many symbols that represent spirituality, and the rituals of this holiday, Halloween, which could all be included but I thought a few simple shapes would be good to start to test the prototype idea. 

I read about the concept of Visual Music [Heard of Visual Music?](https://www.wired.com/2011/05/visual-music-paul-prudence/) which is something that was coined by a historian discussing Kandinsky's paintings. I found an early female animator named Mary Ellen Bute, who coined a specific kind of Visual Music and created abstract films and animations to illustrate music visually. 

I found one of her films called Spook SPort, from 1940, which involved cut outs of ghosts. She also used light and paintings to illustrate music in a sort of "animated ballet" of visual music. 

*"Mary Ellen made her own first film, _Rhythm in Light_, together with Melville Webber, who had collaborated with James Watson on two classic live-action experimental films, _The Fall of the House of Usher (1928)_ and _Lot in Sodom (1933)._ Webber contributed his experience on those films with making models of paper and cardboard and filming them through such things as mirrors and a cut-glass ashtray to get multiple parallel reflections of the shape.*

I found this to be a really inspiring idea, and all of Mary Ellen's work really resonates with me. I decided to try to create a similar visual effect by filming the paper cut outs of the spiritual symbols reflected in a mirror. I also used irridescent colored cellophane to cover the lense of my iPhone camera and also to cover the flashlight which I placed underneath the paper symbols.
