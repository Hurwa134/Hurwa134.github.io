# Seven In Seven 

## Day 2. Protype 2

Testing the function,look, and feel of visuals illustrating Day 2 guitar meditation/prayer. I created spiritual symbols cut out of paper and filmed them in front of a mirror with colored light to illustrate "visual music".

### How I Approached my Second Prototype

I did another guitar playing session as a prayer/meditation. However, I was feeling very sick and like I had a fever, and I was frustrated with my playing. I could tell that my state of mind was reflected in my playing, it had a more agitated, less calm quality. 

I focused on praying/meditating and what came to mind was that it is Halloween, or Samhain (Celtic). I do have some Celtic roots, so maybe this holiday is more important to me than I thought. This is the night that the "veil" is supposed to be lifted between the waking life and what we can't see, according to the lore. It also made me think about the idea of the Day of the Dead, and the idea of being able to communicate with your ancestors spiritually. I thought of my grandmothers who I never got to meet, who I believe watch over me. I wondered if in my prayer through music on Halloween I could connect with them better. 

I was feeling really ill and wasn't playing well, and felt exasperated with my guitar playing (it feels like I've forgotten how to play, or like my fingers don't do what I want them to. I used to practice all the time, and it feels like I'm so rusty.) What I remembered is that this exercise is like yoga, or a practice in the Wabi-Sabi philosphy - that there is beauty in imperfection. 

When I played I tried to think about what imagery would accompany this meditation/prayer playing session. I wanted to incorporate Halloween or Samhein because I was thinking about that and the idea of spirits and ancestors.

[Day Two Visuals - Spiritual Symbols on Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVY_mZ1hBm4)

Continuing with the idea of each guitar session as prayer through music inspiring a different visual art or an accompanying experience or interaction, I tried to think of spiritual symbols. I wanted first to include ghosts or spirits. I also wanted to include some kind of veil that could be lifted, like lifting a bridal veil on film, or lifting fabric to symbolize the "lifting of the veil" that seperates the "spiritual" world on Halloween according to legend. I wasn't sure how to illustrate that.

I looked up celtic symbols related to Samhein, and symbols related to Halloween but I wanted to stay closer to symbols that are meaningful to me personally and which remind me of my prayer or meditation. I think the symbolism in paganism and celtic lore, and the metaphor of the veil could be really interesting to incorporate visually however. 

I found the symbol of the lotus flower, which represents purity, and spirituality in Buddhism, as well as re-birth. It grows in the deepest muddiest places and is also a symbol of perserverence, like the pheonix. I also learned that different colored lotus flowers have different meanings in Buddhism and Eastern philosophies. The lotus is personally important to me as a symbol of spirituality relating to my yoga practice, so I drew two lotus flowers on white paper and cut them out.

Since I was thinking about my ancestors and relatives who I feel spiritually connected to during my meditation, I drew angel wings to represent them and cut them out of paper as well.

I think there are many symbols that represent spirituality, and the rituals of this holiday, Halloween, which could all be included but I thought a few simple shapes would be good to start to test the prototype idea. 

I read about the concept of Visual Music [Heard of Visual Music?](https://www.wired.com/2011/05/visual-music-paul-prudence/) which is something that was coined by a historian discussing Kandinsky's paintings. I found an early female animator named Mary Ellen Bute, who coined a specific kind of Visual Music and created abstract films and animations to illustrate music visually. 

I found one of her films called *Spook Sport*, from 1940, which involved cut outs of ghosts. She also used light and paintings to illustrate music in a sort of "animated ballet" of visual music. 

*"Mary Ellen made her own first film, *Rhythm in Light*, together with Melville Webber, who had collaborated with James Watson on two classic live-action experimental films, *The Fall of the House of Usher (1928)* and *Lot in Sodom (1933).* Webber contributed his experience on those films with making models of paper and cardboard and filming them through such things as mirrors and a cut-glass ashtray to get multiple parallel reflections of the shape.*

I found this to be a really inspiring idea, and all of Mary Ellen's work really resonates with me. I decided to try to create a similar visual effect by filming the paper cut outs of the spiritual symbols reflected in a mirror. I also used irridescent colored cellophane to cover the lense of my iPhone camera and also to cover the flashlight which I placed underneath the paper symbols. 

Again, I learned that I definitely need to use a tripod and get a better system for filming, with this prototype. My hands also appeared in the video and I think it would be better to use some kind of invisible thread, and I think there could be more interesting ways of creating infinity/illusions with paper and cardboard in mirrors. I would want to try it with more intricate cut outs and also incorporate shadows, and use more spiritual symbols. I would also like to do more of a thought-out, meaningful choreography with the different symbols to accompany the music in an expressive way that has more meaning. I really liked how the irridescent cellophane looked with the white paper, and I think the reflections in the mirror are pretty as well as a good metaphor for the idea of the "spirit world/that which we can't see" and our waking reality.
