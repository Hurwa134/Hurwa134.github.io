# Seven In Seven 

## Day 6. Protype 6

Still not feeling well from Mono and I was really tired. My Macbook encountered a serious technical difficulty the past two days, so I had to spend many hours fixing it and on the phone with Apple support. Today was a rough day, so I didn't get to put as much time into my project today as I had planned.

Despite this, I feel very inspired by this project, and I am especially uplifted and excited about playing guitar. I forced myself to play guitar, but today's session is shorter. It did help me to calm down and relieve some worries. I also prayed to have my issues all work out and feel better and peaceful. I was reminded again of the magical experience I feel when I play music of being transported to another world, where I don't have any worries. It is an escape, and I think that is very spiritual and ephemeral. It's a relief, and comfort.

What I thought about again was the concept of imperfect perfection, or Wabi-Sabi. It's okay that I didn't play very much today and that I didn't feel it was very good, because I made the effort and that's what is important, and that's how I get better.
