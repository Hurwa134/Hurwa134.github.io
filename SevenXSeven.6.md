# Seven In Seven 

## Day 6. Protype 6

I felt really sick and tired, and resisted playing. Playing did help me to calm down and relieve some worries. I also prayed to have my issues all work out and feel better and peaceful. 

When I fixed my computer finally (major issue with my laptop the past few days), I went back to playing guitar and I tried to express how grateful I was through my playing. 

It made me remember that prayer and meditation about gratitude is really powerful and changes how I feel. I have been worried and stressed and not happy, so this helped me change my state of mind and remember how much it helps to focus on gratitude and the feeling of being grateful. That is a really spiritual feeling and a powerful feeling for me, and being able to express that through playing feels important in the context of my question - "What if music was a religion to me?" I think focusing on gratitude is key.

I was reminded again of the magical experience I feel when I play music of being transported to another world, where I don't have any worries. It is an escape, and I think that is very spiritual and ephemeral. It's a relief, and comfort.

What I thought about again was the concept of imperfect perfection, or Wabi-Sabi. It's okay that I didn't play very much today and that I didn't feel it was very good, because I made the effort and that's what is important, and that's how I get better.

I really like the idea of Wabi-Sabi/Kintsugi and gratitiude being themes for visuals. I was thinking I could create some kind of imagery that could be projected onto objects or sculpture to express this. 

My first idea was a collage, or some kind of artwork, projected onto a sculpture. I think a collage expressing gratitude projected onto a sculpture that shows that it has been broken and put back together more beautifully, like a pheonix or a lotus, to show strength and perseverence could be really interesting.

I have also been thinking about the snow lion, which represents fearless positivity in Buddhism. I would love to make a statue of a snow lion that shows the cracks filled with gold/like in Kintsugi art, or imperfection as in Wabi-Sabi philosophy. A projection of a collage of artwork that expresses gratitude could make the snow lion light up and have imagery projected on/around it.
